# OSI-430-a
# has two data streams: 1) the "nominal" ICDR that applies exactly the same algorithm
# as OSI-450-a and has a latency of 16 days, and 2) the "fast-track" ICDR that applies
# a slightly different algorithm (tie-point selection) and achieves a latency of 2 days.
# The fast-track ICDR was introduced for the third release after requests from
# operational climate users.
