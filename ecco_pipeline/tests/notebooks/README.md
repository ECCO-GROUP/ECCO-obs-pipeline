# Dataset Notebooks

This directory contains a notebook per supported dataset. Once the harvester has been run for a given dataset, the notebook will perform a test transformation on a single granule and will plot a map of the results for verification.

The conda environment used by the rest of the pipeline (`ecco_pipeline` for a default installation) can be used as the notebook's kernel, as it contains all required dependencies to run the notebooks.
