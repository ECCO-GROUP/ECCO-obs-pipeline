# Tests

The `quicklook_notebooks` directory contains per-dataset notebooks. Each notebook takes an already harvested granule, transforms it, and makes a quicklook plot of the transformed data.

The unittests are currently being built out in their respective directories (ie: `ecco_pipeline/harvesters/tests`)
